    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
    To make a cheesecake, start by mixing 200g of crushed graham crackers (or digestive biscuits) with 100g 
    of melted unsalted butter. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a springform pan to form the crust, 
    and chill it in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes. For the filling, beat together 600g of softened cream 
    cheese, 100g of granulated sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until smooth. Add 3 large eggs, one at 
    a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, blend in 200g of sour cream and, if you want extra tang, add 
    1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Pour the filling over the chilled crust and bake at 325°F (163°C) for 50-60 
    minutes, until the edges are set but the center is slightly jiggly. Once done, turn off the oven, crack the 
    door open, and let the cheesecake cool gradually for an hour. Afterward, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, 
    ideally, overnight. Serve with your favorite toppings, slice, and enjoy!
