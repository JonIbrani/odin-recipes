    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
    To make a Margherita pizza, start by preheating your oven to the highest temperature, ideally 500°F (260°C), 
    and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up. Roll out a pizza dough (about 250g) on a floured 
    surface until it’s roughly 12 inches in diameter. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving 
    a small border around the edges for the crust. Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella cheese (about 125g) evenly on
     top of the sauce, then scatter fresh basil leaves over the cheese. Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza 
     for added flavor. Carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes, 
     or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbling. Once done, remove from the oven, add a few 
     more fresh basil leaves if desired, slice, and serve hot. Enjoy!
